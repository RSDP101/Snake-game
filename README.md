# Snake-game
This was the famous 'Snake Game' which I developed in Python. 
I used pygame library.
You can execute it in your terminal or through the Python Shell if you have it installed in your computer. 

P.S.: In order to run the game in your computer, you need to [install]([url](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)) Pygame on your computer.
